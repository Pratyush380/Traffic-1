## Traffic

A web forum where users can share traffic updates (jams,diversions,construction work etc.) for other users and alert law enforcement moderators to traffic violations (someone jumping a light at an intersection where police isn't deployed, a hit and run) along with details of the culprits vehicle if they can.
